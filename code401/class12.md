# Stacks and Queues

## Stack:A stack is a limited access data structure - elements can be added and removed from the stack only at the top

## Queues:means to insert an item into the back of the queue

### The difference between stacks and queues is in removing. In a stack we remove the item the most recently added; in a queue, we remove the item the least recently added.

## FIFO & LILO and LIFO & FILO
- Queue: First In First Out (FIFO): The first object into a queue is the first object to leave the queue, used by a queue.
- Stack: Last In First Out (LIFO): The last object into a stack is the first object to leave the stack, used by a stack
- Stack: First In Last Out (FILO): The first object or item in a stack is the last object or item to leave the stack.
- Queue: Last In Last Out (LILO): The last object or item in a queue is the last object or item to leave the queue.
