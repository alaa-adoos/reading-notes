# Linear Regressions

## ways to do Linear Regressions:
- numpy
- scipy
- stats model
- sckit

## Scikit-learn is a powerful Python module for machine learning. It contains function for regression, classification, clustering, model selection and dimensionality reduction

### Y = boston housing price(also called “target” data in Python)
### X = all the other features (or independent variables)

## Important functions to keep in mind while fitting a linear regression model are:
- lm.fit() -> fits a linear model
- lm.predict() -> Predict Y using the linear model with estimated coefficients
- lm.score() -> Returns the coefficient of determination (R^2). A measure of how well observed outcomes are replicated by the model, as the proportion of total variation of outcomes explained by the model.
