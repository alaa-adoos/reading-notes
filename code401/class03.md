# **Big O Notation**
## Big O notation is used in Computer Science to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm. 

- **O(1)  describes an algorithm that will always execute in the same time (or space) regardless of the size of the input data set**


- **O(N) describes an algorithm whose performance will grow linearly and in direct proportion to the size of the input data set**


- **O(NÂ²) presents an algorithm whose performance is directly proportional to the square of the size of the input data set**



- **O(2^N)    denotes an algorithm whose growth doubles with each addition to the input data set.** T
