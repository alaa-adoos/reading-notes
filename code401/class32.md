# Intro to Next.js & Tailwind CSS

## What is Next.js?
### Next.js is a flexible React framework that gives you building blocks to create fast web applications


## How to create a Next.js App
### here are many important details you need to consider:
- Code has to be bundled using a bundler like webpack and transformed using a compiler like Babel.
- You need to do production optimizations such as code splitting.
- You might want to statically pre-render some pages for performance and SEO. You might also want to use server-side rendering or client-side rendering.
- You might have to write some server-side code to connect your React app to your data store.

## Tailwind CSS
- Tailwind’s flexbox and padding utilities (flex, shrink-0, and p-6) to control the overall card layout
- The max-width and margin utilities (max-w-sm and mx-auto) to constrain the card width and center it horizontally
- The background color, border radius, and box-shadow utilities (bg-white, rounded-xl, and shadow-lg) to style the card’s appearance
- The width and height utilities (w-12 and h-12) to size the logo image
- The space-between utilities (space-x-4) to handle the spacing between the logo and the text
- The font size, text color, and font-weight utilities (text-xl, text-black, font-medium, etc.) to style the card text
