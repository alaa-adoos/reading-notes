# data structures
## A data structure is a specialized format for organizing, processing, retrieving and storing data. 

## **how data structures are used**:
- Storing data. Data structures are used for efficient data persistence, such as specifying the collection of attributes and corresponding structures used to store records in a database management system
- Managing resources and services. Core operating system (OS) resources and services are enabled through the use of data structures such as linked lists for memory allocation, file directory management and file structure trees, as well as process scheduling queues
- Data exchange. Data structures define the organization of information shared between applications, such as TCP/IP packets.

## Linked list. A linked list stores a collection of items in a linear order. Each element, or node, in a linked list contains a data item, as well as a reference, or link, to the next item in the list.
