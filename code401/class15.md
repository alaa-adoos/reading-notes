# Tree Data Structure
## A tree is a nonlinear hierarchical data structure that consists of nodes connected by edges

## Tree Terminologies
- Node:is an entity that contains a key or value and pointers to its child nodes, The last nodes of each path are called leaf nodes or external nodes that do not contain a link/pointer to child nodes
- Edge:It is the link between any two nodes
- Root:It is the topmost node of a tree
- Height of a Node:the height of a node is the number of edges from the node to the deepest leaf
- Depth of a Node: is the number of edges from the root to the node
- Height of a Tree: is the height of the root node or the depth of the deepest node
- Degree of a Node: is the total number of branches of that node.
- Forest:A collection of disjoint trees
