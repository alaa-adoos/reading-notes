# Encryption, decryption, and cracking

## Encrypting a message
## Imagine Caesar wants to send this message:
```
SECRET MEETING AT THE PALACE
```
## Here's what that might look like encrypted:
```
YKIXKZ SKKZOTM GZ ZNK VGRGIK
```

### three key aspects of data encryption:
- Encryption: scrambling the data according to a secret key (in this case, the alphabet shift).
- Decryption: recovering the original data from scrambled data by using the secret key
- Code cracking: uncovering the original data without knowing the secret, by using a variety of clever techniques
