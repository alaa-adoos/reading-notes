# Creational Patterns:

## Some Creational Patterns:
- Factory Method. The factory pattern is used to replace class constructors, abstracting the process of object generation so that the type of the object instantiated can be determined at run-time.

- Singleton. The singleton pattern ensures that only one object of a particular class is ever created. All further references to objects of the singleton class refer to the same underlying instance.

- Abstract Factory. The abstract factory pattern is used to provide a client with a set of related or dependent objects. The “family” of objects created by the factory are determined at run-time.
