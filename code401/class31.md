# Component Based Architecture

## What is a Component?
### A component is a modular, portable, replaceable, and reusable set of well-defined functionality that encapsulates its implementation and exporting it as a higher-level interface

## Characteristics of Components
- Reusability − Components are usually designed to be reused in different situations in different applications. However, some components may be designed for a specific task.

- Replaceable − Components may be freely substituted with other similar components.

- Not context specific − Components are designed to operate in different environments and contexts.

- Extensible − A component can be extended from existing components to provide new behavior.

- Encapsulated − A A component depicts the interfaces, which allow the caller to use its functionality, and do not expose details of the internal processes or any internal variables or state.

- Independent − Components are designed to have minimal dependencies on other components.
