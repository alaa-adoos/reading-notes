# Hashtabels

## Hash: A hash is the result of some algorithm taking an incoming string and converting it into a value that could be used for either security or some other purpose
## Buckets :  A bucket is what is contained in each index of the array of the hashtable. Each index is a bucket. An index could potentially contain multiple key/value pairs if a collision occurs.
## Collisions :  A collision is what happens when more than one key gets hashed to the same location of the hashtable.

## why we need hashtable?
- Hold unique values
- Dictionary
- Library

## what is hashtable?
### hashtables are a data structure that utilize key value pairs. This means every Node or Bucket has both a key, and a value
