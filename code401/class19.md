# Django
## Django is a high-level Python web framework that enables rapid development of secure and maintainable websites

## Django helps you write software that is:
- Complete:Django follows the "Batteries included" philosophy and provides almost everything developers might want to do "out of the box". 
- Versatile:Django can be (and has been) used to build almost any type of website â€” from content management systems and wikis, through to social networks and news sites. It can work with any client-side framework, and can deliver content in almost any format (including HTML, RSS feeds, JSON, and XML).
- Secure:Django helps developers avoid many common security mistakes by providing a framework that has been engineered to "do the right things" to protect the website automatically
- Scalable:Django uses a component-based "shared-nothing" architecture (each part of the architecture is independent of the others, and can hence be replaced or changed if needed)
- Maintainable:Django code is written using design principles and patterns that encourage the creation of maintainable and reusable code
